# Trading Performance Ranking System

## Introduction

This project aims to build a ranking system that identifies the top-performing traders from a dataset provided in a CSV file. The dataset contains trade data and the associated performance metrics of various traders, such as profit and loss (PnL), return on investment (ROI), Sharpe ratio, win rate, and maximum drawdown (MDD). 

The ranking system processes this data and calculates a score for each trader based on various performance metrics. The system uses a weighted scoring method to rank the traders. The metrics used in the scoring system are:

- **Total PnL**: The total profit or loss generated by the trader.
- **Total ROI**: The average return on investment across all trades.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of risk-adjusted return.
- **Win Rate**: The percentage of profitable trades.
- **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**: The largest peak-to-trough decline in cumulative profit.

The final result is a ranking of traders based on their overall performance, providing insights into the top traders for investment or analysis purposes.

## File Structure

The project has the following folder structure:

/Data File <- This folder contains output files generated by the ranking system. - final_account_ranking.csv <- CSV file containing the top-performing traders and their metrics.

/Python File <- This folder contains Python code files. - RankingSystem.ipynb <- Jupyter notebook for data analysis and ranking calculations. - RankingSystem.py <- Python script containing the ranking system implementation.

/assets <- This folder contains images used for the website. 

/styles <- This folder contains CSS stylesheets for the website. 
    -style.css <- General styles. 
    -home.css <- Styles for the home page. 
    -task.css <- Styles for the task page. 
    -DataExploration.css <- Styles for the data exploration page. 
    -report.css <- Styles for the report page. 
    -result.css <- Styles for the results page.

index.html <- Main HTML file for the website. 
home.html <- HTML file for the home page. 
task.html <- HTML file for the task page. 
DataExploration.html <- HTML file for data exploration. 
report.html <- HTML file for report page. 
results.html <- HTML file for displaying results. 
script.js <- JavaScript file for interactive functionality.


## Output

The system generates a CSV file as the output, which contains a list of traders and their performance metrics. The file `final_account_ranking.csv` includes the following columns:

- **Port_IDs**: The unique identifier for each trader.
- **Total_PnL**: The total profit or loss of the trader.
- **Total_ROI**: The average return on investment for the trader.
- **Sharpe_Ratio**: The Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return.
- **Max_Drawdown**: The largest drawdown the trader experienced.
- **Win_Rate**: The percentage of winning trades for the trader.
- **Total_Positions**: The total number of trades executed by the trader.
- **Win_Positions**: The number of profitable trades executed by the trader.
- **Rank_Score**: The final score based on the weighted evaluation of the above metrics.

This output CSV file allows for easy review and further analysis of the top-performing traders.

## Conclusion

This ranking system provides a powerful way to identify the top-performing traders from a given dataset. The rankings are based on multiple performance metrics that give a holistic view of each trader's ability. The generated CSV output file can be used for further analysis or reporting.
